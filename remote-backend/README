Task 6. Clean up the workspace
First, revert your backend to local so you can delete the storage bucket. Copy and replace the gcs configuration with the following:
terraform {
  backend "local" {
    path = "terraform/state/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
Copied!
Initialize the local backend again. Type yes at the prompt to confirm.
terraform init -migrate-state
Copied!
In the main.tf file, add the force_destroy = true argument to your google_storage_bucket resource. When you delete a bucket, this boolean option will delete all contained objects.
Note: If you try to delete a bucket that contains objects, Terraform will fail that run.
Your resource configuration should resemble the following:


resource "google_storage_bucket" "test-bucket-for-state" {
  name        = "qwiklabs-gcp-01-8d7da656cd9d"
  location    = "US" # Replace with EU for Europe region
  uniform_bucket_level_access = true
  force_destroy = true
}
Copied!
Apply the changes. Type yes at the prompt to confirm.
terraform apply
Copied!
You can now successfully destroy your infrastructure. Type yes at the prompt to confirm.
terraform destroy
